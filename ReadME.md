# Sentiment Analysis using BERT-based Model

Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, typically as positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we use a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)-based model to perform sentiment analysis on text data.

## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in NLP and has various applications, such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and more. In this project, we demonstrate how to use a pre-trained BERT-based model for sentiment analysis. BERT is a powerful transformer-based architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, you need to ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- TensorFlow Hub
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tqdm
- tokenization.py (provided)

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tqdm

Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash

git clone <repository_url>
cd Sentiment-Analysis-BERT
Download the dataset (Amazon Fine Food Reviews) from the following link and place it in the project directory: Dataset

Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate"
Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.

Follow the instructions in the code to preprocess the dataset, tokenize the text data, and train the BERT-based model.

Project Structure
The project directory structure is as follows:

bash
Copy code
├── Sentiment_Analysis_BERT.ipynb      # Jupyter Notebook containing the code
├── tokenization.py                    # Tokenization script
├── data/
│   ├── Reviews.csv                    # Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset
│   └── ...                            # Other datasets (if applicable)
├── logs/                               # TensorBoard logs (for model visualization)
└── README.md                           # Project documentation
Data Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded from Reviews.csv, and irrelevant columns are dropped.
The target variable, sentiment, is transformed into a binary classification task (positive or negative sentiment).
HTML tags are removed from the text data.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and tokenization is performed on the text.
Model Architecture
The BERT-based model is used for feature extraction from the tokenized text data.
The extracted features are then passed through a custom neural network for sentiment classification.
Training
The model is trained on the training dataset.
Training progress and metrics (AUC) are monitored using TensorBoard.
Testing
The trained model is tested on the testing dataset.
Predictions for sentiment (positive or negative) are generated.
Results
The model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrix, are evaluated on the test data.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using a BERT-based model. The model achieved competitive results and can be further fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks or used as a feature extractor for other downstream tasks.
